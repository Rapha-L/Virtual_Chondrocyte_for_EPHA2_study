# Virtual_Chondrocyte_for_EPHA2_study
Updated version of the Virtual Articular Chondrocyte regulatory network model with addition of EPHA2 connections to study the role of EPHA2 in chondrocyte phenotype control and support the experimental twin study. The content of this repository is meant to reproduce the in silico results presented in the twin publication (MN. Ferrao Blanco et al.)

This repository contains the equations and algorithms used to run the analyses in twin publication by M.N.F Blanco et al. zbout EPHA2 in articular chondrocytes. 

- The equations represent an updated version of the intracellular regulatory network of biomolecules defining articular chondrocytes phenotypes from R.Lesage et al. (2022) [1], complemented with informatiojn about EPHA2 and its activity in the chondrocyte network. 

- The scripts allow running  simulations, permoring in silico experiments to study the role of EPHA2 and analyse the simulation outputs to reproduce the publication's in silico results.
