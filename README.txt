This repository contains the equations and algorithms used to run the analyses in twin publication by M.N.F Blanco et al. zbout EPHA2 in articular chondrocytes. 

- The equations represent an updated version of the intracellular regulatory network of biomolecules defining articular chondrocytes phenotypes from R.Lesage et al. (2022) [1], complemented with informatiojn about EPHA2 and its activity in the chondrocyte network. 

- The scripts allow running  simulations, permoring in silico experiments to study the role of EPHA2 and analyse the simulation outputs to reproduce the publication's in silico results.
